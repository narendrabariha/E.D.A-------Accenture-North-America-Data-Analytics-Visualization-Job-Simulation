Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation - October 2024 🎯📊

I recently completed a simulation through the Forage platform, where I had the opportunity to act as a Data Analyst at Accenture, advising a hypothetical social media client. This experience was instrumental in enhancing my data analytics skills.

During the simulation, I cleaned, modeled, and analyzed seven datasets using Excel to uncover insights into content trends. These insights were crucial in informing strategic decisions for the client. 📈✨

I also prepared a comprehensive PowerPoint deck and delivered a video presentation to effectively communicate key findings to both the client and internal stakeholders. This experience solidified my passion for data analytics and visualization, and I am excited about the possibility of applying these skills in a real-world setting! 🚀🔍
